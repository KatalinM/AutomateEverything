# Create your first class in Python - introducing OOP

## What the heck are the Objects and what is Object Oriented Programming?

Start your journey into the rabit hole with [this kind video made for Kids learning programming](https://youtu.be/X3cFiJnxUBY?si=4V7RW28fRKyrPsM_)

After you see this is not a rocket science or brains surgery right? Right. Level up a bit:
Obect-oriented programming, simplified by Programming with Mosh [link](https://youtu.be/pTB0EiLXUC8?si=pZJA8mDpAw0vs6AD)
Later you can dipe deep with this [MIT video](https://youtu.be/-DP1i2ZU9gk?si=Wrm6bD4LRIBHZkZc) but learn by doing is also a good practice.
And this is a [whole course about Python OOP](https://youtu.be/JeznW_7DlB0?si=-vfqyKfhRzuvnrRa), simulatneously you can go on with it too.
