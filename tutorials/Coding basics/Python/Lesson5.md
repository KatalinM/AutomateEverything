# Install Python and a Code editor on your computer

OK before we dive deeper, we need to choose a code editor (mine favorite for python is Visual Studio) and a python interperter.
The latest stable python version at the time of this tutorial is made is 3.13 but at many projects you will meet still python 3.6 or python 3.8 as simply sometimes too painfull to update a whole project and all the dependencies... but if you start from scratch why not to use the lates one right?

[Visit Python webpage](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the lastest version, no magic, next-next finish will do its job. Just remember where did you installed it, it may be needed when you want to give the python interpereter path for the code editor.

In case you are lost and need a bit more visual help, visit youtube for [Installing and setting up VS Code](https://youtu.be/EUJlVYggR1Y?si=LW-q4l3oliIxsbUI) or  [getting started with python on VS Code](https://youtu.be/D2cwvpJSBX4?si=AqNfZTLVXWmwi5MP) (You can skipp installing Homebrew and simply install python with the downloaded exe file)

Now open your downloaded code editor and create your first project eg. Lesson4 :)
Create a folder with name  "Lesson!" on your computer wherever you will find it and open this folder in VS Code. Tadam, your first project is created.

Test if whether everything is settled fine, try to write your first print("Hello World") into a new test.py file and try to run it. Its output should be seen in the terminal window.

If not so, maybe still you need to install python package for the VS Code, probably already VSCode suggested it :), do it.
Find it in View > Extensions, search for python. (Python, Pylance and Python Debugger from Microsoft is what we would need)

Now surely you can run your first message to the console.
