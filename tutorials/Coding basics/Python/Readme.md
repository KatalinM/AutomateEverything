# Coding Basics with Python

If you decided you want to be a test automation engineer, it is a must have to be able to learn some programming language and you also need to learn how to learn alone. What is the hardest, to decide, what to learn and where to begin. Thatâ€™s why I made this learning material but I will not hold your hand. Of course you can ask me any time you need help (if I am not sitting right beside you ðŸ˜Š you can always find me at katalin.molnar.kiss@gmail.com) but when you feel stucked the right order to find help is:

1. code duck/rubber duck: gone through your code and tell to someone/something, for example a duck, what you have done, how it works, and what is your problem. Say it out loud, it is important â€“ because when you speaks and explain something, you are using the different side of your brain than during coding or debugging. Explain it as you would explain it to your grandma or for a 6 year old kid.
OK, it not always helps. Go further.

2. Google. Yes we google all the day, sometimes for help, sometimes for a very basic sytax, because we do not use everything every day and simply forget. Don't be shy, it is not a shame...

3. Stackoverflow: most of the google searches will lead you anyway to stackoverflow but can be happen that your question is still not raised.. :) Programmers community is - mostly - a very helpful and supportive community, for the most common questions you will find an answer. Or if not, at least you know that you are not the only one in the world who has no idea how to solve it...

4. chatgpt/copilot: these tools ar great, sometimes, but please left this kind of help for the less used one, moreover during learning. AI tools are like a good coding duck, but their answer is not 100% reliable... can give you a good hint, and even can you suggest pages/videos where you can look after the solution of the problem (first try this kind of help from it)
    - Example for good use:
    "Dear ChagGPT (it is important to be kind, you can never know when the machines might rebel and you want to have a good relationship with one of them :D),
    I am a beginner in programming and I am not sure how to sort a list. I am learning python. Please give me some online reference where I can understand the logic of the sort method and where I can learn the syntax"

    - Example for bad use:
    "this is my imput: [12, 33, 44, 11, 33]
    expected output: [11, 12, 33, 44]
    write me the method which gets the input and gives back the output." - you will not learn anything from this and in case the method is more complicated (hopefully later will deal with much more complicated methods), can provide not readable and not fully reliable methods and you will not even notice it.

## How this Python coding basics tutorial builds up:

[Lesson 1](../Python/Lesson1.md) - Basic syntax of python and basic programming structures
[Lesson 2](../Python/Lesson2.md) -  Learn how to install Python and how to write and run your first program from terminal
