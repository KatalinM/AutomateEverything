# Lesson 1 Basic syntax of python

You loved the logic theme in High School? Great, because this is the base of all programming. In case you not works for NASA or donâ€™t want to be an AI expert or deal with simulation software, most probably will not need any deep math knowledge, but basic logic is a must as this is how you can instruct the machine via code. But start with babysteps:

## The key elements of programming knowledge:

1. Marks, quatations etc.
    
    '='     assigns a value to a variable.
        eg.
        ```python
            name = "Anna" # The variable here is the "name", the value of the "name" variable is "Anna".
        ```
    
    '" "'       marks that a String type has been ordered to the variable - Check - [strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)
    
    '#'     comments out in the line everything after it, so will not be executed in the code - idal for debugging or code commenting

    '=='    means equals, the same as simple = in math

2. Variables :
    Variables are everything :) They are like x in math.
    Variables is a short and clear word that express the data it holds.
    Variable can be a number (integer or float), a single letter or word (string), a whole list (marked with []), a dictionary (marked with {}) and a lot of else.. but start with these.

    A variable is created when you assign a value to it and should alway represent what it holds... :
            eg.
        ```python
            best_girl_name = "Anna" # The variable here is the "best_girl_name", the value of the variable is "Anna".
            best_boy_name = "Tom"

            best_girl_names = ["Anna", "Isabella", "Dorothy"]
            best_boy_names = ["Tom", "Andrew", "Roy"]

            girls_with_age = {"Anna": 22, "Isabella": 21, "Dorothy": 25}
            # format for dictionary can be also valid if you split lines for more readability, eg:
            girls_with_age = {
                "Anna": 22, 
                "Isabella": 21, 
                "Dorothy": 25
                }
            
        ```
