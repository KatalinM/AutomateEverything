# Lesson 2: Learn how to install Python and how to write and run your first program from terminal

First install Python to your machine. [Here](https://www.theserverside.com/video/How-to-install-Python-on-Windows) you can find a tutorial for Windows users and a one for [Linux users](https://youtu.be/IAco2SSuGms?si=PxnDNoPE0rE6pSG)

You will need some kind of code editor (Code editors are tools that helps to write, edit and run code, integrated with tools for debugging and many things). For Python there are some good choices, eg. PyCharm or VSCode. I use VSCode, but its my choice, its not a Bible. The result will not be different, any code editor will make your work easier. 

[Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) you can download <em>Visual Studio</em>
 - [a short tutorial video](https://youtu.be/B-s71n0dHUk?si=dfa89hCa5FHCv3a4) for Visual Studio  ~ 7 min
 - [a bit more detailed tutorial](https://youtu.be/VqCgcpAypFQ?si=BshijcB3s9lBJvcD) ~ 33 min

 in case you prefer - based on.. your instincts - 
 [Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows) you can download PyCharm
 - [a short tutorial video](https://youtu.be/HHcZbXsZtm0?si=6NWsdN93bpCMKvi0) for <em>PyCharm</em> ~ 10 min
 - [a longer one](https://youtu.be/FOMCutgRUtY?si=SMBTlYZLXpubAOKM) ~ 23 min

 If you are not statisfied with any of them during learning, find <em>your</em> best choice. A [hint](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial/python-ide) for it.

 Now, after you installed, python and settled up your code editor, its time to write and run your first code.
