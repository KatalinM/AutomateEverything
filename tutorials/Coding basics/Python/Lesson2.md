# Lesson 2: Learn how to install Python and how to write and run your first program from terminal

First install Python to your machine. [Here](https://www.theserverside.com/video/How-to-install-Python-on-Windows) you can find a tutorial for Windows users and a one for [Linux users](https://youtu.be/IAco2SSuGms?si=PxnDNoPE0rE6pSG)

You will need some kind of code editor. For Python there are some good choices, eg. PyCharm or VSCode. I use VSCode, but its my choice, its not a Bible. The result will not be different, any code editor will make your work easier.
